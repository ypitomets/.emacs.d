;;; Commentary:

;; M-x tex-math-preview previews TeX math expressions.  Put point in a TeX,
;; LaTeX, Texinfo, Wikipedia or DBTexMath math expression and M-x
;; tex-math-preview shows either an image or TeX error messages.
;;
;; `tex-mode' has its own far more substantial buffer and region previewing,
;; but tex-math-preview is intentionally simpler and is geared towards
;; unsophisticated TeX users.
